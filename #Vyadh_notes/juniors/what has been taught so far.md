- basics of electronics:
	- ohms law, circuitry
	- resistor capacitors inductors, their use in a circuit
- a brief intro to arduino. how to use it
	- basics analog and digital read and write function
	- serial function
	- PWM, ADC
	- floating pins, pull up and pull down resistors
	- a brief on how UART works
- motor drivers, IR sensor, ultrasonic sensor
- mentioned about datasheets and circuit diag
- rams
- inputs and outputs, what it means for a voltage to be a signal



tasks given so far:
- voltage reduction circuit without using voltage dividers
- research on IR sensors and make a circuit on it
- control 5 LEDs using buttons connected to the same port
- asked them to buy components (all of them have)
- motor control using a H bridge and potentiometer
- research on communication protocol
- why does LED flicker instead of gradually increasing when controlled by a pot
- research on ultrasonic sensors
- (task told to solve during session) cascaded LED control code 
- potentiometer servo indirect control
