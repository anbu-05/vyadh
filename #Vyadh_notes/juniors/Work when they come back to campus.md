- finish and show their line follower bot
- disassemble the rover, and give them access to all the parts and all the codes. they have to put the rover together and run it. they'll have the PDB, traversal board, motor drivers, required wires and connectors, ESPs, reciever and controller, all the codes in each ESP handed to them. they can ask me doubts about everything but i wont directly tell them what to put where. they gotta find out what it is, how to use it, how it's implementedÂ in our rover. ill be supervising everything so they dont damage anything costly. but that's it. they'll have a month to figure everything out and get the rover running
