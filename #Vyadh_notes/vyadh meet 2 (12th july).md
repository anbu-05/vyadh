- there were 74 juniors during their time
- he is suggesting everyone must be there in the first week, they have to learn how the team is crowded
- and we have to introduce the rotation as something new to the juniors. it shouldn't be pre-planned
- the more time they spend in the lab, the more they will be attached. dont give any restrictions on coming to the lab.
- he talked about how only half the people who joined stayed
- he told about astrobio: no tasks were given. only two people who responded were Meenakshi's friends were there. no classes happened.
- **we can take the juniors down for the first week to manage the population**
- create a plan on how to accommodate, and plan on rotation only if you feel like there are too many people

- the first week should be a technical interaction with the juniors. 
- he discussed who is free in the mornings to go to dsw and clean the lab
- he gave details on how to get night slip permission: need to get signature of captain, fc (benedict), adsw (reddy muthra, or pradeep sir), chief dsw (naiju), chief security
