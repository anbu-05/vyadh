toggle for rover movement, inverse kinematic arm control, manual arm control, and stats.

toggle to rover movement:
	-joystick for rover control. the control will be analog, not WASD. ill prove it with the babybot.
	-the oled display will tell the realtime gps position of the rover
	-calibrate button to tackle stick drift and instability

toggle to inverse kinematic arm control:
	-4 joysticks for control
	-oled display will tell theoretical position in workspace, actual position in workspace, theoretical joint angle, actual joint angle from encoders
	-The joystick inputs will increment or decrement the workspace position rather than directly controlling the joints in real time
	-calibrate button to tackle stick drift and instability


toggle to manual arm control mode:
	-4 joysticks for control
	- +/- for turntable rotation
	-oled display will tell theoretical position in workspace, actual position in workspace, theoretical joint angle, actual joint angle from encoders
	-The joystick inputs will increment or decrement the joint positions rather than directly controlling the joints in real time
	-calibrate button to tackle stick drift and instability
 
toggle for stats:
	-button that will cycle through the three batteries' voltage levels in each cell

toggle for science kit mode:
	-8 +/- buttons for 4 pumps
	-2 stepper buttons
